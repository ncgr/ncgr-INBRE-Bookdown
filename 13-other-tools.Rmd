https://github.com/pangenome/odgi

+ Manuscript:
    + https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.10.467921v1
+ Documentation:
    + https://odgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
    
“A toolkit for understanding pangenome graphs.”

Functionality:

1. Explore graphs via 1D and 2D visualization
2. Detect complex regions in the graph
3. Extract selected loci
4. Sorting and laying out, e.g. in preparation for visualization
5. Navigating and annotating graphs, e.g. bringing annotations in
to Bandage
6. Remove artifacts and complex regions
7. MultiQC report for graph statistics

### seqwish

https://github.com/ekg/seqwish

+ Dissertation
    + https://github.com/ekg/seqwish
    
“The sequences wish they were squished into a graph.” 

+ Converts pairwise alignments between sequences into a variation graph, i.e. pangenome.

+ Takes one or more PAF files as input (e.g. output of minimap2)
+ Infers graph nodes and node orderings from alignment blocks
and how they overlap between sequences.

###  smoothxg

https://github.com/pangenome/smoothxg

“Linearize and simplify variation graphs using blocked partial order alignment.”

+ “Smooths” graph by consolidating structures that are artifacts of graph assembly / data.


## Other Mapping, Variant Calling, and Genotyping Tools

+ Manuscript
    + https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-02157-2
    
“Aligns long reads to genome graphs. Compared to the state-of-the-art tools, GraphAligner is 13x faster and uses 3x less memory. When employing GraphAligner for error correction, we find it to be more than twice as accurate and over 12x faster than extant tools.”

### GraphTyper / GraphTyper2

+ Manuscripts
    + https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3964
    + https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13341-9

“A graph-based variant caller capable of genotyping population-scale short read data sets. It represents a reference genome and known variants of a genomic region using an acyclic graph structure (a "pangenome reference"), which high-throughput sequence reads are re-aligned to for the purpose of discovering and genotyping SNPs, small indels, and structural variants.”

+ GraphTyper2 is the v2 release of GraphTyper, i.e. the same GitHub repository

### BayesTyper

https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper

+ Manuscript:
    + https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0145-5

Performs genotyping of all types of variation by exactly aligning sequence k-mers to a reference graph and then using Bayesian inference built on a “variation-prior” database to do genotyping.

BayesTyper enables “sensitive and accurate genotyping across classes and varying lengths of structural variants” as compared to other methods

## Future Tools

+ Data compression!
+ This research is happening now
  + Developing techniques that allow computation directly on compressed data
  + Techniques specifically for pangenomes
  + Fundamental data compression algorithms still need to be solver
  + Usable software is still a few years away...
