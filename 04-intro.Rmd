# Introduction to Pangenomics

## What is a "pangenome"?

The term “pangenome” was first coined by Sigaux et al. and was used to describe a public database containing an assessment of genome and transcriptome alterations in major types of tumors, tissues, and experimental models.

The term was later revitalized by Tettelin et al. to describe a microbial genome by which genes were in the core (present in all strains) and which genes were dispensable (missing from one or more of the strains).

### Then vs. Now

![Cost per Genome: https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/DNA-Sequencing-Costs-Data](./Figures/CostGenome.png){width=90%}

- Low Cost
- High Quality Long Reads (HiFi)
- Many reference-quality assemblies per species

### "Pangenome" Today

“Any collection of genomic sequences to be analyzed jointly or to be used as a reference. These sequences can be linked in a graph-like structure, or simply constitute sets of (aligned or unaligned) sequences.” – Computational Pangenomics Consortium

https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/19/1/118/2566735

### The Benefit of Pangenomes

+ Removes reference bias
  + May only represent one organism
  + Could be a “mosaic”of individuals, i.e. doesn’t represent a coherent haplotype
  + Allele bias
  + Doesn’t include common variation
+ Allow multiple assemblies to be analyzed simultaneously, i.e. efficiently

###  What are pangenomes good for?

+ Core vs dispensable genes:
  + How big is the core?
  + How big is the dispensable?
  + How big is the pangenome?
  + What traits are associated with the core/dispensable?
+ Unbiased read mapping and variant calling
+ More robust variation-trait association
+ Visual exploration of genomic structure of population

##  Computational Pangenomics

“Questions about efficient data structures, algorithms and statistical methods to perform bioinformatic analyses of pan-genomes give rise to the discipline of ‘computational pan-genomics’.”

### Pangenome Representations

+ Gene sets
+ Multiple sequence alignments
+ K-mer sets
+ Graphs
  + De Bruijn graphs
  + Haptotype graphs
  + **Variation graphs**

### Variation Graphs

+ Variation forms bubbles Nodes represent sequences
+ Chains of nodes represent contiguous sequence in one or more assemblies
+ The sequences of nodes connected by an edge may overlap
+ Graphs can be acyclic or cyclic
+ Haplotypes are “threaded” through graph as paths

### Types of Variation Graphs

1. Reference Graph (vg)
  + A reference with variants
  + E.G. [Human reference now includes VCF with common variation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/human/)
2. Reference Backbone; “iterative” (minigraph)
  + Graph starts as reference and other sequences are layered
on, i.e. variants can be relative to sequences other than the
reference
3. Reference-Free (Cactus and pggb)
  + Graph is built using non-reference techniques, such as multiple sequence alignment


These are all methods used by the [Human Pangenome Reference Consortium](https://humanpangenome.org)

### We Changed the Names

+ YPRP FASTA files only contain chromosome names
+ We prefixed every chromosome with its assembly name and a "." delineator
  + e.g. S288C.chrVIII
