Online (by the National Center for Genome Resources (NCGR) Santa Fe, NM)


## Objective{-}

Students will leverage their Unix and R command knowledge and become familiar with the SingleCellExperiment and Seurat R packages as well as an interactive Shiny web application to perform statistical metrics and data visualization for a variety of bioinformatic approaches to single cell sequencing analysis. 

## Audience{-}

This advanced workshop is targeted towards undergraduate or graduate students in biology or related fields.  

## Prerequisites{-}

Unix, sequencing basics and other study guides will be provided upon acceptance.

What to expect upon acceptance

Email confirming acceptance into the internship program and further details.

## Logistics{-}

The workshop will be conducted virtually using primarily Zoom as our conferencing platform.  We will also use a variety of other software and tools, and you will log onto NCGR’s Unix analysis server for the command line tools.  After the workshop, students can use our analysis server for their research or education purposes for up to one year.
