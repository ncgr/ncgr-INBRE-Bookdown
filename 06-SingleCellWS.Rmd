## Objective{-}

Students will leverage their Linux and R command knowledge to become familiar with the SingleCellExperiment, Seurat R packages, Loupe Browser, and an interactive Shiny web application to perform statistical metrics and data visualization for a variety of bioinformatic approaches to single cell sequencing analysis. 

## Audience{-}

This advanced workshop is targeted towards undergraduate or graduate students in biology or related fields.

## Prerequisites{-}

Reference material will be provided upon acceptance.

## Logistics{-}

The workshop will be conducted virtually using primarily Zoom as our conferencing platform. We will also use a variety of other software and tools, and you will log onto NCGR’s analysis server for the command line tools. After the workshop, students can use our analysis server for their research or education purposes for up to one year. Late applications will not be accepted. Participants will be accepted shortly after the deadline. If any questions arise while reviewing your application packet, we will contact you directly.
