## Audience{-}


This workshop is targeted towards undergraduate or graduate students in biology or related fields.  


## Prerequisites{-}

Unix, sequencing basics and other study guides will be provided upon acceptance.

What to expect upon acceptance

Email confirming acceptance into the internship program and further details.

## Logistics{-}

The workshop will be conducted virtually using primarily Zoom as our conferencing platform.  We will also use a variety of other software and tools, and you will log onto NCGR’s Unix analysis server for the command line tools.
